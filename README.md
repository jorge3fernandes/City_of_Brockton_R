# City of Brockton - Public Data meets Data Science

A project focused on web scraping the Brockton Police website for dispatch logs to identify opportunities to better the community.

## Getting Started

For more details look into the `src` directory:

-  `CRAWLER.R` for how I'm crawling the website
-  `Parser.R` for how I'm converting PDFs to texts and extracting relevant informations
-  `Analysis.R` for how I'm shaping the data and extracting meaningful insights

### Prerequisites

The project is written entirely in **R** at the moment. An updated version of
**R** and **RStudio** should be sufficient to run all the codes.
