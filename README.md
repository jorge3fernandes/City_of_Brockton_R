# City of Brockton - Fighting crime using Data Science

This project is focused on web scraping the Brockton Police website for dispatch logs to identify opportunities to fight crimes.  

For more details look into;
- CRAWLER.R for how I'm crawling the website
- Parser.R for how I'm conversing the PDFs to texts and extracting relevant informations
- Analysis.R for how I'm shaping the data and extracting meaning insights



#### This is a work in progress, so feel free to contact me via email (jorge3fernandes@gmail.com) if you have some ideas that you'd like to discuss.
