# City of Brockton - Public Data meets Data Science

This project is focused on web scraping the Brockton Police website for dispatch logs to identify opportunities to better the community.  

For more details look into;
- CRAWLER.R for how I'm crawling the website
- Parser.R for how I'm converting PDFs to texts and extracting relevant informations
- Analysis.R for how I'm shaping the data and extracting meaningful insights



#### This is a work in progress, so feel free to contact me via email (jorge3fernandes@gmail.com) if you have some ideas that you'd like to discuss.
